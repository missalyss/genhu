              <p>Generations Humanitarian is committed to transform street children toward an abundance of health, 
                hope, and loving homesâ€”thereby breaking the cycle of scarcity for generations to come. 
                This is done through broad research, novel development, strengthening nonprofit entities in development, 
                and individual nurturing in a home environment.
